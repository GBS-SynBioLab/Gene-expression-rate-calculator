# Gene-expression-rate-calculator
Author: Nicolas Kylilis PhD Date: 19th June 2018

Intended purpose: 
Matlab program for automatic calculation of gene expression rate from time-course fluorescence assays on microplate-reader for bacterial cells

Experimental design (microplate layout): 
Data analysis will only take place correctly if the following microplate layout is applied. Column 1: Media blank Column 2: Control cells for growth rate and autofluorescence Columns 3 up to 12: Sample conditions Rows A up to G: Replicates

Data analysis: 
Open matlab software and run "growth_rate_module.m" file script. (Instructions for file naming etc can be found in the script)
