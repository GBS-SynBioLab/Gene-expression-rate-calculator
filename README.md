# Gene-expression-rate-calculator
Author: Nicolas Kylilis PhD 

Intended purpose:
-----------------
Automated data analysis workflow for the calculation of gene expression rate

Suitable for time-course fluorescence assays on microplate-reader for bacterial cells

Experimental design (microplate layout):
----------------------------------------
Data analysis will only take place correctly if the following microplate layout is applied. 

Column 1: Media blank

Column 2: Control cells for growth rate and autofluorescence

Column 3-12: Sample experimental conditions

Rows A-H: Replicates


Data analysis:
--------------
Open matlab software and run "growth_rate_module.m" file script. (Instructions for file naming etc can be found in the script)
